### About

Made entirely in SPA style with Vanilla JS using Mobile First techniques [Learn More Here](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00), CraftBeer House is a professional-level site that I build after [Prime Fitness](https://github.com/Miltonr87/Prime-Fitness) project to test a new way to create Web App based first on Mobile, in order to decrease CSS lines and Media Queries resources for Mobile and Desktop resolutions. CraftBeer was also used to explore the creative power of the Bootstrap library, so this project was done 100% with it, from the slide, buttons to the modals resources.
